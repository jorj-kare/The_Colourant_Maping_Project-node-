# The Colourant Mapping Project

Archaeological research has unearthed a vibrantly
colourful ancient world: from Egyptian sarcophagi to Pompeian houses
and from tinted glass to scarlet red textiles, recent advances in
archaeological science have led to the identification of a plethora of
materials used to colour things. Minerals, metals, plants, earths,
and even sea molluscs are found among the colourants of the ancient palette.

The Colourant Mapping Project aims to systematically record the
occurrences of ancient pigments, dyes, and other painting materials.
This interactive mapping web application aims to create an open-access database
of ancient colourants that can be used by researchers and the wider
public to illustrate patterns of exchange and highlight regional variations.
The project relies on the contributions of its users, who can submit
through the designated form. Each entry will be reviewed by our team to avoid
duplicates and ensure the academic integrity of the database. Our
will be updated and new entries will be included shortly after your
submissions becomes more colourful every single day!
