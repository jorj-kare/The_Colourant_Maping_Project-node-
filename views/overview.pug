            p.overview__text Archaeological research has unearthed a vibrantly
                |  colourful ancient world: from Egyptian sarcophagi to Pompeian houses
                | and from tinted glass to scarlet red textiles, recent advances in 
                | archaeological science have led to the identification of a plethora of 
                | materials used to colour things. Minerals, metals, plants, earths, 
                | and even sea molluscs are found among the colourants of the ancient palette.

            p.overview__text The Colourant Mapping Project aims to systematically record the
                |occurrences of ancient pigments, dyes, and other painting materials. 
                |This interactive mapping web application aims to create an open-access database 
                |of ancient colourants that can be used by researchers and the wider
                |public to illustrate patterns of exchange and highlight regional variations. 
                |The project relies on the contributions of its users, who can submit
                | 
                a.overview__link(href="/newEntry" ) new entries
                | 
                | through the designated form. Each entry will be reviewed by our team to avoid
                |duplicates and ensure the academic integrity of the database. Our
                | 
                a.overview__link(href="/map" ) map
                | 
                |will be updated and new entries will be included shortly after your
                |submissions. 
            p.overview__text We are looking forward to our next steps as our map
                |becomes more colourful every single day!
